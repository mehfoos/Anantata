    <h1>Open Calculator</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Much of our knowledge of the universe can be described through a set of mathematical equations and numerical constants. This is an attempt at building and maintaing an open source database and calculator of equations and universal constants.
    </p>
    <h2>Intent and Design Principles</h2>
    <p>You can submit additions or edits to the database, and can also programmatically query the database. A minimalist interface is used to keep the website lightweight and compatible with a wide range of applications. You are welcome to use the existing database to create your own interfaces.</p>
